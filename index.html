<button class="accordion">Where Can I Buy Tickets?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p style="font-size:14px;">Star Cloud Hall is a venue with no seating and is general admission. You buy tickets at the front gate! First come first serve!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is allowed in the venue?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
      <ul>
        <li>No guns, knives, weapons, pepper spray, projectiles of any kind, or any other item that could be used to inflict harm.</li>
        <li>Replicas of any type of weapon are NOT permitted.</li>
        <li>No drugs or drug paraphernalia, illegal substances of any kind.</li>
      </ul>
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">I lost my cell phone / credit card / wallet / jacket / etc. at Star Cloud Hall? What do I do?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p style="font-size:14px;">Star Cloud Hall maintains a "Lost And Found" box at its offices. Call 732-000-0000 to discuss the matter. Remember: Though we do our best to unite lost items with their owners, Starland Ballroom is not responsible for items left on the premises.
     After 6 months, unclaimed cell phones are donated to military and/or domestic abuse charities.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Do you have a medical staff onsite during events?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p style="font-size:14px;">We have medical staff present at every event that takes place at Starland,
     no matter the attendance.  Should you need assistance during a show please locate the closest staff member and they will be able to help.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What time does my show start or end?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p style="font-size:14px;">We generally don't know in advance when a show will begin or end. Door times
    are posted for each show; the starting time for each show is generally (but not always) 30 to 60
     minutes afterwards. The ending time varies by show; you should check with security or the box office on the way in for information.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">The weather outside is frightening. Is my show canceled?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p style="font-size:14px;">If your event is canceled, and you bought your tickets online or via the phone, you will be refunded automatically. If you bought your tickets through a retail outlet or the Starland Ballroom box office,
     you will need to return to your original point of purchase to obtain a refund.</p>
